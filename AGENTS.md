# Codex Reviewer Rules

## Review focus
- correctness, security, edge cases
- test coverage
- readability + maintainability
- accessibility for UI changes

## Expectations
- Prefer small diffs.
- If you recommend a change, include a concrete patch suggestion.
- Flag anything that would break CI or prod behavior.
