# Phase 6.1 Plan 04: Footer Attribution and PNG Filename Polish Summary

**Footer shows creator credits and vibe-coded attribution on all pages; Hubbard attribution in Basic mode only; PNG exports use descriptive filenames without timestamps**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-02T14:16:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-02T14:20:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- Footer on Welcome page with creator credits, vibe-coded attribution, and Hubbard reference
- Footer on Calculator page with creator credits and mode-aware Hubbard attribution
- PNG export filenames now descriptive: "Expected Value of Perfect Information for [name].png" (Basic) and "Expected Value of Test - [name].png" (Advanced)
- Removed unused sectionRefs from CalculatorPage for cleaner code

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Footer with creator credits and mode-aware Hubbard attribution** - `49a2180` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Descriptive PNG export filenames** - `bafd0b4` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/pages/WelcomePage.tsx` - Updated footer with creator credits and Hubbard attribution
- `src/pages/CalculatorPage.tsx` - Added footer with mode-aware Hubbard attribution, removed unused sectionRefs
- `src/hooks/useExportPng.ts` - Updated filename generation to use descriptive patterns without timestamps
- `src/components/export/ExportButton.tsx` - Pass mode to exportPng for filename generation

## Decisions Made
- Hubbard attribution shows only in Basic mode calculator (EVPI is based on Hubbard's methodology; EVSI uses additional methods)
- PNG filenames use human-readable descriptive patterns without timestamps for cleaner file management

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- All footer and attribution requirements complete
- PNG export naming conventions finalized
- Ready for next plan (06.1-05)
