# Phase 6.1 Plan 03: Default Prior Option & Sigma Display Summary

**Added 'Fill with Recommended Default' button to Advanced mode with Eppo attribution, hidden sigma in Basic mode, renamed to 'std dev' in Advanced mode**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-02T19:16:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-02T19:21:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Advanced mode now has same "Fill with Recommended Default" button as Basic mode
- Eppo attribution text appears below the default button in Advanced mode
- Basic mode interval summary no longer shows sigma (cleaner UX)
- Advanced mode interval summary shows "std dev" instead of "sigma" (more familiar term)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add default prior button to Advanced mode** - `0fac668` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Wire default button and update sigma display** - `6fb4799` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/components/forms/PriorShapeForm.tsx` - Added onUseDefaultPrior prop and default prior button with Eppo text
- `src/components/forms/UncertaintyPriorForm.tsx` - Wired handleUseDefault to PriorShapeForm, updated sigma display logic

## Decisions Made
- Eppo attribution included in default prior button text to credit the prior used in their Bayesian analysis
- Sigma hidden in Basic mode since most users don't need to see it
- Used "std dev" instead of "sigma" in Advanced mode as it's more widely understood

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Default prior option complete in both modes
- Ready for next plan (06.1-04)
