<objective>
Generate design specifications for Welcome screen and Calculator page using Stitch MCP before implementation.

Purpose: DESIGN-05 requires using Stitch MCP for design before implementation. These designs will guide all UI implementation in subsequent plans, ensuring consistent visual language and UX patterns.

Output: Design specification documents capturing Stitch MCP outputs for Welcome screen (mode selection) and Calculator page (wizard sections, progress indicator, navigation).

@SPEC.md (Section 11 UX flow, Section 12 Design requirements)

**LOCKED DECISIONS from CONTEXT.md:**
- Two-page architecture: Welcome screen -> Calculator page
- Single scrollable page for calculator (all sections visible)
- Future sections visible but dramatically disabled
- Sticky mini-indicator (small numbered dots)
- Completed steps: checkmark replaces number
- Generic "Back"/"Next" buttons
- Mode toggle: cards on welcome, segmented buttons in header

**Design Direction from SPEC.md Section 12:**
- Datadog-adjacent visual language
- Clean, modern, high-contrast UI
- Subtle gradients, rounded cards, crisp typography
- Restrained palette with one bright accent for CTAs
- Charts match UI styling

  <action>
    1. Create designs directory:
       ```bash
       mkdir -p .planning/phases/01-foundation-wizard-infrastructure/designs
       ```

    2. Use Stitch MCP to generate Welcome screen design with this prompt:

       **Design Prompt for Stitch:**
       "Design a Welcome/landing screen for 'Should I Test That?' - an A/B test decision-value calculator for non-technical PMs.

       Requirements:
       - Two side-by-side cards for mode selection: 'Basic Mode' and 'Advanced Mode'
       - Basic Mode card: 'Quick estimate, fewer inputs' - features: EVPI calculation, 3 business inputs, guided prior
       - Advanced Mode card: 'Precise value, more inputs' - features: EVSI calculation, test design inputs, Cost of Delay
       - Cards should be selectable (radio group semantics) with clear selection state
       - Headline: 'Should I Test That?' with subtext about deciding if A/B tests are worth running
       - 'Get Started' button to proceed after mode selection
       - Datadog-inspired visual language: clean, modern, high-contrast, subtle gradients, rounded cards
       - Restrained color palette with purple/indigo as primary accent
       - Desktop-first layout (1200px max-width container)
       - Include brief explanatory text about what the tool does"

    3. Capture Stitch output and save to designs/welcome-screen.md with:
       - Component hierarchy
       - Layout specifications
       - Color/typography tokens
       - Interaction states (hover, selected, disabled)
       - Responsive breakpoints
       - Accessibility notes

    4. Document any Stitch suggestions that deviate from CONTEXT.md locked decisions (note these for user review in checkpoint).

    1. Use Stitch MCP to generate Calculator page design with this prompt:

       **Design Prompt for Stitch:**
       "Design a multi-section calculator page for 'Should I Test That?' - an A/B testing decision-value calculator.

       Page Structure:
       - Single scrollable page with all 4 sections visible (not tabs or hidden steps)
       - Sections: Baseline Metrics, Uncertainty (Prior), Shipping Threshold, Results
       - Future sections appear dramatically disabled until prior sections complete
       - Disabled state: heavy opacity reduction (40%), grayscale filter, muted borders

       Header Requirements:
       - Sticky header with app title and mode toggle
       - Mode toggle: segmented control buttons [Basic] [Advanced]
       - Mode toggle always visible, allows switching anytime

       Progress Indicator:
       - Sticky mini-indicator below header (or integrated)
       - Small numbered dots/circles for each section
       - Current section highlighted (primary color fill)
       - Completed sections show checkmark replacing number (green)
       - Future sections muted/grayed
       - Mobile: keep horizontal, abbreviate labels

       Section Card Design:
       - Each section is a rounded card with clear heading
       - Section number and title (e.g., '1. Baseline Metrics')
       - Enabled state: full contrast, interactive
       - Disabled state: 40% opacity, grayscale, 'Complete previous section to unlock' message
       - Navigation buttons at bottom of each section: 'Back' / 'Next'

       Visual Style:
       - Datadog-adjacent: clean, modern, high-contrast
       - Subtle gradients, rounded cards (8px radius), crisp typography
       - Primary accent: purple/indigo for CTAs and active states
       - Muted gray for disabled states and secondary text
       - Desktop-first (1200px max-width), but mobile-friendly
       - Consistent spacing (16px, 24px, 32px scale)"

    2. Capture Stitch output and save to designs/calculator-page.md with:
       - Page layout structure
       - Header component design
       - Sticky indicator component design
       - Section wrapper component design (enabled vs disabled states)
       - Navigation buttons design
       - Scroll behavior specifications
       - Color tokens and spacing scale
       - Responsive adaptations

    3. Specifically document:
       - scroll-mt value for sticky header offset
       - IntersectionObserver rootMargin suggestion for scroll tracking
       - Disabled section styling (opacity, grayscale, pointer-events)

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
    Generated design specifications using Stitch MCP for:
    1. Welcome screen with two mode selection cards
    2. Calculator page with all sections visible, sticky indicator, dramatically disabled future sections

    Design files saved to:
    - .planning/phases/01-foundation-wizard-infrastructure/designs/welcome-screen.md
    - .planning/phases/01-foundation-wizard-infrastructure/designs/calculator-page.md
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Review designs/welcome-screen.md:
       - Does the mode selection match your vision? (Two cards, Basic vs Advanced)
       - Is the visual style Datadog-inspired? (Clean, high-contrast, purple accent)
       - Any layout or copy changes needed?

    2. Review designs/calculator-page.md:
       - Does the all-sections-visible layout feel right?
       - Is the disabled state dramatic enough? (40% opacity + grayscale)
       - Does the sticky indicator design match your mini-dots concept?
       - Is the scroll behavior well-specified?

    3. Flag any deviations from your CONTEXT.md decisions that need resolution.

    4. Note any changes you want before implementation proceeds.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
    Type "approved" to proceed with implementation using these designs.
    Or describe specific changes needed (e.g., "change disabled opacity to 30%", "add more spacing between sections").

    **Note:** For minor tweaks, describe changes and I'll update the design files. For major design direction changes requiring significant rework, consider returning to /gsd:discuss-phase to update CONTEXT.md before re-running this plan.
