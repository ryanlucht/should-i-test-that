## Problem

User feedback during Phase 6 context gathering: "the design is a little plain" and there are opportunities to improve:
- Input fields are too wide for their 1-10 character content
- Could use inline labels with compact inputs
- Overall component-level polish could be improved

Current design is functional but not distinctive.

## Solution

Use Stitch MCP to generate 3 design direction mockups:
1. **Current spec style** — Apply existing design tokens consistently
2. **Datadog + Y2K** — Bolder, more distinctive (dark backgrounds, gradients, glows)
3. **Minimal/clean** — Whitespace-forward, monochrome accents, Linear/Notion-inspired

Scope: Component-level polish (buttons, cards, inputs, colors) while keeping overall layout.

Stitch project already created: `projects/1068587262916723814` with initial explorations.

**Deferred to:** v2 or future milestone
