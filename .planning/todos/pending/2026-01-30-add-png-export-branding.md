## Problem

User requested no branding for v1 PNG export, but wants to add attribution in a future version. When sharing exported PNG cards, users may want others to know what tool generated it.

## Solution

TBD — Add subtle "Created with Should I Test That?" footer or small logo to exported PNG. Consider:
- Footer text vs. corner watermark
- Link/URL to the tool
- Option to toggle branding on/off
