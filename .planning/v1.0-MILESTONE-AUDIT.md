## Tech Debt Summary

Accumulated but non-blocking items:

### Phase 3: Calculation Engine
- **Truncation for edge case priors** — For priors where P(L<-1) > 0.1%, full truncation and re-normalization would improve accuracy. Current detection is in place; actual truncation deferred as it affects negligible number of real-world use cases.

### Phase 5: Advanced Mode (Intentional Deferrals)
- **ADV-IN-08, ADV-IN-09 (Test Costs)** — Hard costs and labor inputs deferred to v2 per 05-CONTEXT.md. Net value currently shows EVSI - CoD only.
- **ADV-OUT-06 (EVPI comparison)** — Showing "EVSI ≤ EVPI" teaching point deferred to v2.

**Total tech debt items: 3** (all intentional scope decisions, not defects)

## Build & Test Status

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tests | 262/262 passing |
| Test Files | 15 |
| Build | Success (886KB main + 58KB worker) |
| TypeScript | No errors |
| Lint | Passing (warnings only) |

## Conclusion

**Milestone v1.0 is COMPLETE and ready for release.**

- All 67 requirements satisfied (3 intentionally deferred to v2)
- All 7 phases verified and passing
- All cross-phase integrations working
- All E2E user flows complete
- 262 tests passing
- No critical gaps or blockers
